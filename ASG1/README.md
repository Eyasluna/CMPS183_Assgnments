##Requirements
Build a website with three pages:
• index.html
• todo.html
• todoForm.html
Each of the three pages consists of a header, footer, a content panel, and a sidebar. These four
components should be visually separated using borders and/or background colors or images.
Directly below the header is a navigation bar with elements labeled “Home”, “To Do List”, and “To Do
Form” linking to index.html, todo.html, and todoForm.html, respectively.
Header
The header shows the text “cmps183: Homework 1”. This text should be clearly legible on top of a
header background image or background color.
The header is the same for all three pages.
Footer
The footer contains links labeled “About Us”, “Contact”, “Privacy”, and “Credits”. These are dummy links
(set href=”#” in the anchor elements).
The footer is the same for all three pages.
index.html
The content section contains a fictitious profile of yourself. To preserve your anonymity for peer review,
do not use your real name, personal data, or a picture of yourself.
The profile should include a picture, name, place and date of birth, contact information, and a few short
biographical paragraphs.
Also, provide a (fictitious) list of courses (to be) taken this academic year, including department, course
number, course title, and quarter.
todo.html
The content panel displays a todo list. Each item in this list has a task title, a notes section, due date, and
a checkbox to indicate whether the task has been completed. Your todo list should contain at least four
items. Provide a menu with operations “Show all”, “Show completed”, and “Show to do”. Selecting
“Show all” will display all items in the todo list, “Show complete” shows the completed items only
(checkbox checked); and “Show to do” shows yet to be done items only (checkbox unchecked).
